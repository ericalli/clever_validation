CleverValidation v0.1
=====================

CleverValidation is an extension to the existing rails validation methods that includes the ability to customize your validation error messages and features javascript functionality for adding a bit of interaction to your validations via scriptaculous effects.


Example
=======

Use this plugin in the exact manner you would use the default error_messages_for method. A basic example would be:

<%= clever_validation_for 'your_model_name', :title => "Sorry, we encountered some errors during your submission.", 
										      :sub_title => "The errors in question are listed below...", 
										      :effect => "pulsate" %>
										
This will display the error messages and a "show me" link next to each error, when clicked, it will scroll a user to the field in question and do the defined effect to it (in this case Effect.pulsate).

The available effects are:

- Pulsate
- Shake
- Highlight
	- highlight_color
	- duration
	
An example with the highlight effect would be:

<%= clever_validation_for 'your_model_name', :title => "Sorry, we encountered some errors during your submission.", 
										      :sub_title => "The errors in question are listed below...", 
										      :effect => "highlight",
										 	  :highlight_color => "eaeaea", 
											  :duration => 8 %>

NOTE: I've overwritten the default rails validation messages for the model validation methods, so you will need to completely define your messages (which, I think would be preferred). Such as:

validates_presence_of :file_name, :message => "This field can't be blank."

So the error will appear exactly as: "This field can't be blank."


Basic CSS Styles:
=================

Here are some basic styles to get your started. Place these into your CSS stylesheet and tweak them as you wish.

div#cleverValidation {
    background: #FFFF99;
	padding: 10px;
	position: relative;
}
div#cleverValidation ul{
	list-style:none;
}
div#cleverValidation a#hideLink {
	position: absolute;
	top: 10px;
	right: 10px;
}
div#cleverValidation a#showMeLink {}
